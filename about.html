                    Hi there!  I'm Elizabeth Roadman-Benjamin.  Friends call me Beth. Colleagues call me dedicated and family calls me loyal.
                    I have a comprehensive background of over 15 years in project management and front-end web development with a little bit of United States Trustee Department of Justice mixed in for good measure.
                    I'm a motivated, personable event professional with a successful track record of aiding in the production, logistics, development and operations of events and projects. Whether it is in New York City,
                    Dallas, Texas or Cleveland, Ohio, I have a talent for quickly mastering technology and adjusting to environment. I pride myself on being diplomatic and tactful with professionals and non-professionals at all levels and accustomed to handling sensitive, confidential records.
                    I have a demonstrated history of producing accurate, timely reports, meeting governmental deadlines and law practice guidelines. Additionally, I'm an advocate of continuing education in event and technology industry.

                    What does it mean? <br />
                </h4>
                  <p> 
                    Everyone has a symbol that represents them.  This is mine. <br />
                    It means my personality is a constantly evolving, which is
                    why I'm best represented by a swirl with dashes.  The swirl represents growth while trying to balance myself.  I'm both confident and insecure, wild and tame, quiet and loud. Creative and analytical.  Moreover, in terms of rebirth or growth, the spiral symbol represents the consciousness of
                    beginning from the core or center and expanding outwardly. A brilliant shout out to the idea of life; while it may not go as planned, it still continues, hiccups and all.
                    The dashes represent my ability to carry relationships throughout my life.
                    I may be a little all over the place, but I'm a fiercly loyal and stable wife, friend, and employee, proudly dedicated to continuing my swirl.
