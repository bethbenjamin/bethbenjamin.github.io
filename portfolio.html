                            <h3> Tuscany Villa<br /></h3>

                            This project was been created with CSS, CSS Grid, and HTML 5.

                                    With the outlook as a junior developer, we will construct the following website as per the mockup from a designer.
                                    You are working as a front-end developer at a marketing agency.

                                    The design team has created a new layout for a client's web site.

                                    Their previous website was done several years back, and was not responsive.

                                    Not only do they want an attractive site featuring homes, but they want to ensure it is usable on all screen sizes.

                                    Below, find the mockups from the design team. They have given us a good amount to work with.

                                    To get the colors right, either choose an online color picker, or download a program (like Gimp) that allows you to choose colors from a picture and tells you their hex values.

                                    The designers didn't specify fonts for us, but want us to get as close as we can to their design images.
